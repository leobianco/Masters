# Practical Session on Random Matrix Theory

This repo contains the code and report (in French) for the _travail pratique_ (practical session) for the course on Random Matrix Theory at MVA.

## Objectives

The goal was to explore the links between spiked models in RMT and the field of community detection on graphs.

## Running the code

Simply call ```python3 main.py``` from your terminal session at the root folder and select a simulation according to the docstring of ```simulations.py```, that is,

Simulation 1 &rarr; the three cases discussed in "preliminary observations".

Simulation 2 &rarr; asymptotic eigenvalues and eigenvectors' alignments.

Simulation 3 &rarr; alignments for growing number n of points.

Simulation 4 &rarr;Â community detection.
