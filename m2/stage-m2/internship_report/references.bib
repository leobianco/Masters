Looking for a latent structure is one of the many strategies used to better understand the behavior of a network. Several methods already exist for the binary case. We present a model-based strategy to uncover groups of nodes in valued graphs. This framework can be used for a wide span of parametric random graphs models and allows to include covariates. Variational tools allow us to achieve approximate maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of these models. We provide a simulation study showing that our estimation method performs well over a broad range of situations. We apply this method to analyze host–parasite interaction networks in forest ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Networks or graphs can easily represent a diverse set of data 
	sources that are characterized by interacting units or actors. Social 
	networks, representing people who communicate with each other, are one 
	example. Communities or clusters of highly connected actors form an 
	essential feature in the structure of several empirical networks. Spectral 
	clustering is a popular and computationally feasible method to discover 
	these communities. The stochastic blockmodel [Social Networks 5 (1983) 
	109--137] is a social network model with well-defined communities; each 
	node is a member of one community. For a network generated from the 
	Stochastic Blockmodel, we bound the number of nodes "misclustered" by 
	spectral clustering. The asymptotic results in this paper are the first 
	clustering results that allow the number of clusters in the model to grow 
	with the number of nodes, hence the name high-dimensional. In order to 
	study spectral clustering under the stochastic blockmodel, we first show 
	that under the more general latent space model, the eigenvectors of the 
	normalized graph Laplacian asymptotically converge to the eigenvectors of a 
	"population" normalized graph Laplacian. Aside from the implication for 
	spectral clustering, this provides insight into a graph visualization 
	technique. Our method of studying the eigenvectors of random matrices is 
	original.},

	abstract = {The stochastic block model (SBM) is a random graph model with 
	planted clusters. It is widely employed as a canonical model to study 
	clustering and community detection, and provides generally a fertile ground 
	to study the statistical and computational tradeoffs that arise in network 
	and data sciences. This note surveys the recent developments that establish 
	the fundamental limits for community detection in the SBM, both with 
	respect to information-theoretic and computational thresholds, and for 
	various recovery requirements such as exact, partial and weak recovery 
	(a.k.a., detection). The main results discussed are the phase transitions 
	for exact recovery at the Chernoff-Hellinger threshold, the phase 
	transition for weak recovery at the Kesten-Stigum threshold, the optimal 
	distortion-SNR tradeoff for partial recovery, the learning of the SBM 
	parameters and the gap between information-theoretic and computational 
	thresholds. The note also covers some of the algorithms developed in the 
	quest of achieving the limits, in particular two-round algorithms via 
	graph-splitting, semi-definite programming, linearized belief propagation, 
	classical and nonbacktracking spectral methods. A few open problems are

	Many deterministic and probabilistic clustering methods have been developed to

	abstract = {Reliably learning group structures among nodes in network data is 
	challenging in several applications. We are particularly motivated by studying 
	covert networks that encode relationships among criminals. These data are subject 
	to measurement errors, and exhibit a complex combination of an unknown number of 
	core-periphery, assortative and disassortative structures that may unveil key 
	architectures of the criminal organization. The coexistence of these noisy block 
	patterns limits the reliability of routinely-used community detection algorithms, 
	and requires extensions of model-based solutions to realistically characterize 
	the node partition process, incorporate information from node attributes, and 
	provide improved strategies for estimation and uncertainty quantification. To 
	cover these gaps, we develop a new class of extended stochastic block models 
	(ESBM) that infer groups of nodes having common connectivity patterns via 
	Gibbs-type priors on the partition process. This choice encompasses many 
	realistic priors for criminal networks, covering solutions with fixed, random and 
	infinite number of possible groups, and facilitates the inclusion of node 
	attributes in a principled manner. Among the new alternatives in our class, we 
	focus on the Gnedin process as a realistic prior that allows the number of groups 
	to be finite, random and subject to a reinforcement process coherent with 
	criminal networks. A collapsed Gibbs sampler is proposed for the whole ESBM 
	class, and refined strategies for estimation, prediction, uncertainty 
	quantification and model selection are outlined. The ESBM performance is 
	illustrated in realistic simulations and in an application to an Italian mafia 
	network, where we unveil key complex block structures, mostly hidden from 
	state-of-the-art alternatives.},

	abstract = {Community detection is a fundamental unsupervised learning 
	problem for unlabeled networks which has a broad range of applications. 
	Many community detection algorithms assume that the number of clusters 
	\$r\$ is known apriori. In this paper, we propose an approach based on 
	semi-definite relaxations, which does not require prior knowledge of model 
	parameters like many existing convex relaxation methods and recovers the 
	number of clusters and the clustering matrix exactly under a broad 
	parameter regime, with probability tending to one. On a variety of simulated 
	and real data experiments, we show that the proposed method often 
	outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for estimating the number of 
	clusters.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02069},
	abstract = {The stochastic block model (SBM) provides a popular framework 
	for modeling community structures in networks. However, more attention has 
	been devoted to problems concerning estimating the latent node labels and 
	the model parameters than the issue of choosing the number of blocks. We 
	consider an approach based on the log likelihood ratio statistic and analyze 
	its asymptotic properties under model misspecification. We show the limiting 
	distribution of the statistic in the case of underfitting is normal and obtain its 
	convergence rate in the case of overfitting. These conclusions remain valid 
	when the average degree grows at a polylog rate. The results enable us to 
	derive the correct order of the penalty term for model complexity and arrive 
	at a likelihood-based model selection criterion that is asymptotically 
	consistent. Our analysis can also be extended to a degree-corrected block 
	model (DCSBM). In practice, the likelihood function can be estimated using 
	more computationally efficient variational methods or consistent label 
	estimation algorithms, allowing the criterion to be applied to large networks.},

	doi = {10.1137/19M1257135},
	abstract = {Spectral algorithms, such as principal component analysis and 
	spectral clustering, rely on the extremal eigenpairs of a matrix \$A\$. 
	However, these may be uninformative without preprocessing \$A\$ with a 
	proper transformation. The reason is that the spectrum of \$A\$ may be 
	contaminated by top eigenvalues resulting from scale variations in the data, 
	such as high-degree nodes. Designing a good \${\textbackslash}psi\$ and 
	establishing what good means is often challenging and model dependent. 
	This paper proposes a simple and generic construction for sparse graphs, 
	\${\textbackslash}psi(A) = 
	{\textbackslash}mathbb\{1\}((I+A){\textasciicircum}r {\textbackslash}ge 1)\$, 
	where \$A\$ denotes the adjacency matrix, \$r\$ is an integer, and the 
	indicator function is applied entrywise. We support this “graph powering” 
	construction with the following regularization properties: (i) if the graph is 
	drawn from the sparse Erdös--Rényi ensemble, which has no spectral gap, 
	then graph powering produces a “maximal” spectral gap, comparable to that 
	obtained when powering a random regular graph; (ii) if the graph is drawn 
	from the sparse stochastic block model, graph powering achieves the 
	fundamental limit for weak recovery (the Kesten--Stigum threshold), settling 
	at the same time a related conjecture by Massoulié in 2013; (iii) we also 
	demonstrate that graph powering is significantly more robust to tangles and 
	cliques than previous spectral algorithms based on self-avoiding or 
	nonbacktracking walk counts, using a geometric block model as our 
	benchmark and introducing new conjectures for this model.},
