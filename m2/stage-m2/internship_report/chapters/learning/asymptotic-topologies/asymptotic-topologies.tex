\section{Asymptotic topologies}  % üìù
\label{sec:asymptotic-topologies}

This section details one factor that might impact algorithms' performance in the 
context of the analysis performed in this chapter: the asymptotic structure of 
the graphs to which they are applied to. First, it is explained how these 
structures appear in models relevant for this report. Then, it is explained how 
this impacts the robustness of algorithms.

\subsection{The case of the Erd\H{o}s-R√©nyi model}
The Erd\H{o}s-R√©nyi model is perhaps the simples model for random graphs, 
and it is denoted \(G(n, p)\), over graphs with \(n\) vertices \cite{erdos59a}. 
Under this model, the 
presence of an edge between each pair of nodes is determined by a Bernoulli 
random variable of parameter \(p\). Notice this makes this model a special case 
of an SBM with one community. See Figure \ref{fig:obs-erdos-renyi}. 
\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{An observation from an Erd\H{o}s-R√©nyi model \(G(30, 0.2)\)}
	\label{fig:obs-erdos-renyi}
\end{figure}

Although this model does not present clusters of nodes, it is nevertheless of 
great interest, since it reveals a key phenomenon: there exist tightly defined 
and distinct \textit{asymptotic topologies} for random graphs arising from this 
model as \(n \to \infty\). Which one arises is a function of the growth of 
\(p\) with respect to \(n\).

\begin{theorem}
	Let \(G(n, p)\) denote the Erd\H{o}s-R√©nyi model on \(n\) nodes and probability 
	\(p\) of connection. Then,
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(G(n, c \log(n)/n)\) is connected with high probability if and only if \(c 
		> 1\).
		\item \(G(n, c/n)\) has a giant component (\textit{i.e.}, a component of size 
		linear in \(n\)) if and only if \(c > 1\).
	\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

		finally becomes connected.}

\subsection{The case of the SBM}  % ‚≠ïÔ∏è
In the SBM, essentially the same phenomenon happens. For the sake of simplicity, 
the result for the symmetric SBM is presented here.
\begin{proposition}
	Let \(\text{SSBM}(n, k, p, q)\) denote the symmetric SBM with \(n\) nodes, \(k\) 
	communities, probability \(p\) for intra-cluster connections, and probability \(q\) 
	for inter-cluster connections. Then,
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For \(a, b > 0\), \(\text{SSBM}(n, k, a \log(n)/n), b \log(n)/n\) is 
		connected with high probability if and only if \(\frac{a + (k-1)b}{k} > 1\).
		\item \(\text{SSBM}(n, k, a/n, b/n)\) has a giant component (\textit{i.e.}, a 
		component of size linear in \(n\)) if and only if \(d \coloneqq \frac{a + 
		(k-1)b}{k} > 1\).
	\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Why does this matter?}  % ‚≠ïÔ∏è
% ----------------------
% pName: EXPLAINING THE INTEREST FOR COMMUNITY DETECTION
% 1. Connect with previous paragraph
This phenomenon is of interest for community detection, because the analysis 
of algorithms takes place asymptotically. Knowing what structures appear can 
provide an intuition to the common hypotheses appearing on consistency 
results regarding the asymptotic regime of the expected degree. It can also 
reveal weaknesses of some methods that rely too heavily on these structures, 
implying a lack of robustness to perturbations.
% 3. Give up to three details
% 4. Brief lead (connector) for next paragraph
