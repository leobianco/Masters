Ch1. Variational inference and the stochastic block model

ยง1.1. Introduction
	Motivate our study and explicit an objective of investigation. Give
informal descriptions of the SBM and of the approaches we will take. 

ยง1.2. The stochastic block model
	Topics: describe the model. Write its likelihood and discuss the
intractabilities involved in it.

ยง1.3. Variational inference
	Topics: KL divergence. Variational decomposition in general. Mean field
approximation, and in particular justifying the choice for multinomial
distributiona. Write down the general ELBO for the SBM. Discuss general
alternate optimization. Example of two disconnected components and Naulet's form for the ELBO. Maximise K=2 ELBO with eigenvectors of the Laplacian.
